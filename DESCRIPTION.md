Welcome to the Lunacy of Linux!
The OS that you thank your lucky stars for every day is actually, in many ways, INSANE!
Some of this craziness makes absolute logical sense, but results in weird (and often security-relevant) situations.
We'll explore some of these in this dojo.

This dojo is open source **and predominantly a community effort**!
Contribute [here](https://github.com/pwncollege/linux-lunacy): if you have an idea of a silly Linux foible to explore, _please_ PR it or suggest it in an issue!
Questions? Comments? Open an issue on github or contact Zardus through whatever channel is most convenient (such as the [official dojo discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/750635557666816031/1282232049679204442))!
